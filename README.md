# HOSPITAL AUTOMATION PROJECT

I created something similar to the MHRS automation.
Appointment information, doctor’s notes, etc., can be accessed for each doctor.
Additionally, there are features like doctor login and patient registration available for administrators.
When our application first opens, these options are displayed.

We log in with a TC (ID number) and password.

If there’s no password, we can register and set one.

The patient can access all appointment information from this screen.
The patient can perform all actions here, such as updating an existing appointment, booking a new appointment, updating their information, etc.

The login process is the same for doctors as well.

Doctors can track, update, and perform necessary actions regarding their information and announcements from here.

I also designed a system for secretaries where they can arrange and manage everything.
